## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
select the desired confidence level, statistical power, and minimum detectable effect (MDE), then choose whether it‚Äôs a one- or two-tailed test. Enter the number of variants (excluding the control), along with your baseline mean, standard deviation, and daily traffic. Once these values are set, the calculator will compute the required sample size per variant, the total sample size, and the estimated duration needed for your test, showing results both with and without a Bonferroni correction. This helps you quickly determine how long your experiment will take and how many samples you need to confidently detect meaningful differences.
